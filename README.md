# bkpkg
Burg Kurg Package Manager

**NOTE:** bkpkg is still under development. Currently, it can:

- Download packages given their source is in `list.csv`

ToDo:

- Move package to server's `plugins` folder
- Implement plugin updating
- Implement `list.csv` updating
- Implement self-updating
- More, probably
- Downloads from sources like Spigot, where the URL doesn't end in `.jar`

Bkpkg is a package manager for Minecraft server admins to easily install and update plugins. Feel free to create a Pull Request to add desired plugins!

The plugins's source must be manually updated in `list.csv`, but `list.csv` can be updated from bkpkg, so we encourage our users to create a Pull Request to update links, so that those changes can be sent to everyone!

Burg Kurg is my own server, and thus I opted to name this program after it. However, this program is for everyone!
